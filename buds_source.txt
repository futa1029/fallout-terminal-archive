'''Bud's Buds''' is an experimental management training group organized by [[Bud Askins]] within the broader [[Vault-Tec Corporation]], featured {{In|FOTV}}.

==Background==
According to Bud, the group's stated goal was to achieve an "absolute monopoly" by outliving and overpowering all other factions. In his own words, "The ultimate weapon of mass destruction is time." The group's members were hand-picked Vault-Tec junior corporate employees, including recent [[Vault-Tec University]] graduates.<ref>[[Bud's Buds!]]</ref> Bud envisioned a [[Vault]] dedicated to his program, which would allow him and his "Buds" to carry out their project past the end of the world. This vision was used by Bud and [[Barb Howard]] during a meeting between them and several key industry figures, intended to encourage Vault-Tec's corporate rivals to support the Vault program by designing their own experimental Vaults.

With the help of Vault-Tec's investors (actually the [[Enclave]]),<ref>{{FOTV|2|8}}: [[Robert House]] confirms to the Ghoul that the "investors" who funded Vault-Tec's facilities were the Enclave.</ref> Bud's vision would eventually come to fruition with the construction of the [[Three Vaults]] beneath [[Santa Monica]], California: the interconnected [[Vault 31|Vaults 31]], [[Vault 32|32]], and [[Vault 33|33]]. Vault 31 would contain only cryostasis pods where members of Bud's Buds would be preserved, while Vaults 32 and 33 would contain actual civilian populations (also hand-picked by Bud and his team for genetically desirable traits). Every thirty years,<ref>[[Bud Askins]]: ''"No, no, no. They're supposed to come out once every thirty years. This isn't even a cogent plan. It's just chaos."''<br />("[[The Innovator]]")</ref> or as needed, a member of Bud's Buds would be awakened from their pod and released from Vault 31 into the population of the other two connected vaults, who had all been taught that Vault 31 was also a normal, populated Vault just like theirs. The Buds would find a way to become the overseers of Vaults 32 and 33, including by engineering disasters, and use their positions to indoctrinate their dwellers into model Vault-Tec citizens. The ultimate goal was to breed a generation of "super-managers" from the original Vault-Tec staff, who would go on to claim the post-War world as their own and lord over it.<ref>[[Norm MacLean]]: ''"So what's Vault 32 and 33? Just people to be controlled?"''<br />[[Bud Askins]]: ''"What? No! When you put it like that, it sounds downright morally questionable. They're our breeding pool, the ultimate expression of HR R&D. Genetically selected to breed with my Buds to create a class of super managers. People with positivity, people who make lemonade. People who will inherit the Earth after we've wiped the surface clean."''<br />("[[The Beginning]]")</ref>

After all competition had been successfully wiped out, with the Buds' intervention or not, all of the Buds would be released onto the surface for [[Reclamation Day (event)|Reclamation Day]], to begin implementing Vault-Tec's corporate strategy. However, this was only the first phase of the experiment, hinted to merely be part of the Enclave's overarching goals for Vault-Tec and the [[wasteland]]. The Vault 31ers were privy, at least to some degree, to the existence of "Phase 2," which was planned by the Enclave "investors" and accepted by Bud: the specifics of this phase are unclear, but it is implied that it would involve the populations of Vaults 32 and 33 and the [[Forced Evolutionary Virus]], which the investors referred to in their discussions as "Future Enterprise Ventures."<ref name="ronnie">[[Ronnie McCurtry|Ronnie]]: ''"Hey, boss. Now that we've found food, it's time for phase two?"''<br />[[Norm MacLean]]: ''"What is your name?"''<br />Ronnie: ''"Oh, um, I'm Ronnie. McCurtry."''<br />Norm MacLean: ''"I decide the next steps up here, Ronnie."''<br />Ronnie: ''"I know, yeah, you're the-- you're the boss. I know you call the shots. Just thought I'd introduce myself, 'cause I was Bud's personal assistant."''<br />Norm MacLean: ''"Hm, so?"''<br />Ronnie: ''"So, uh, let's just say I was the guy who took the lunch orders when Bud was meeting with the Vault investors. 'Future Enterprise Ventures'? The whole plan for Vaults 32 and 33?"''<br />Norm MacLean: ''"What do you know about that?"''<br />Ronnie: ''"Like I said, I was just the guy who got the lunch orders, but I do know that Phase 2 was very important to the experiment."''<br />({{FOTV|2|4}})</ref><ref name="s2e5">{{FOTV|2|5}}</ref>

===Post-War===
[[File:FOTV Vault 31 Cryobay.png|thumb|250px|left|Bud's Buds members in the cryobay of Vault 31]]
On the day of the bombs, the members of Bud's Buds flocked to [[Vault 31]], where they would then enter cryonic pods similar to those found in [[Vault 111]], planning to reawaken one day in the future and covertly integrate into the populations of the two connected Vaults.<ref name="highly supervised">Norm MacLean: ''"Is this where my dad's from?"''<br />[[Bud Askins]]: ''"You'll never find out. Oh. He's gonna find out. These are Bud's Buds. My Buds. America outsourced the survival of this country to the private sector. But it would have been insane to keep a failed nation alive. So, we kept Vault-Tec alive instead. A well-trained staff of highly supervised junior executives from my own assistant training program. Because the future of humanity comes down to one word: Management."''<br/>([[The Beginning]])</ref> By [[2296]], around 219 years after the [[Great War]], the majority of the group's members were still dormant in their cryostasis.<ref name="fotv107">{{FOTV|1|7}}</ref>

The experimental process carried on uninterrupted for 217 years up until 2294, when the residents of Vault 32 apparently managed to figure out the truth behind the three Vaults and Vault 31's "management." This caused them to rebel, destroying their home and capturing and killing their overseer before seemingly turning on and killing each other; their corpses remained strewn around the Vault for the next two years before [[Lee Moldaver]]'s [[Vault 32 raider|group of raiders]] infiltrated Vault 32 and pretended to be Vault 32 dwellers to invade Vault 33, for which a cover story was invented that 32 had suffered a famine.

[[Bud Askins]] himself was able to live past the Great War for all 219 years to the present by turning himself into a so-called "[[Bud Askins|brain-on-a-roomba]]." By 2296, some members of Bud's Buds that awoke and left Vault 31 were also still alive, including [[Hank MacLean]], [[Betty Pearson]], and [[Steph Harper|Stephanie Harper]]. They worked to continue the experimental program even after the failure of Vault 32 and the raid on Vault 33, with the staff cleaning up Vault 32 to hide the truth and then having dwellers from Vault 33 reassigned to resettle Vault 32.

In July 2296, Hank's son, [[Norm MacLean]], entered Vault 31 and discovered the truth behind Bud's Buds. Bud locked him into the Vault, intending to silence him either through death or coercing him into entering a cryopod, but this went awry. Norm soon sabotaged the inter-Vault communications, preventing Bud and his Buds in the other Vaults from interacting,<ref>{{FOTV|2|1}}</ref> and killed Bud by damaging his robotic body. He simultaneously released 22 of the frozen [[Vault 31 dweller]]s, including [[Clark (TV series)|Clark]], [[Claudia (TV series)|Claudia]], [[Pete (TV series)|Pete]] and [[Ronnie McCurtry]]. He convinced them that he was their new leader, and then relied on their knowledge of Vault 31 to escape to the surface.<ref>{{FOTV|2|2}}</ref> Bud's death and Vault 31's abandonment was later discovered by his incumbent overseer subordinates Betty and Steph.<ref name="dead">[[Steph Harper]]: ''"Empty. You're positive?"''<br />[[Betty Pearson]]: ''"Evacuated cryo pods. No sign of Norman. My god, Steph. I found Bud Askins upside-down in a mop bucket."''<br />Steph Harper: ''"So, 31 has been abandoned. It's just you and me now, Bets."''<br />Betty Pearson: ''"I suppose it is. A brave new world. So, we need to cooperate. The water crisis in 33 is getting worse."''<br />Steph Harper: ''"If I give you access to our Vault's water supply, it would taint the work we're doing here."''<br />Betty Pearson: ''"Bud is dead. What work are you talking about?"''<br />Steph Harper: ''"The same work we've always been doing, Betty. Trying to survive."''<br />({{FOTV|2|4}})</ref>

Despite Bud's death, his trainees remained convinced of his plans and still intended to carry them out. Bud's personal assistant Ronnie McCurtry was privy to Phase 2 (to some degree), and he led the reactivated Vault 31 dwellers to the former [[Vault-Tec headquarters (TV series)|Vault-Tec building]] with the intention of contacting the investors to begin Phase Two. After the discovery of Norm's deception, the trainees ended up falling victim to a [[Radroach (TV series)|radroach]] attack in the Vault-Tec headquarters. Norm and Claudia managed to survive, while the rest of the executives were killed or maimed, though Ronnie's fate is unknown.<ref>{{FOTV|2|8}}</ref>
